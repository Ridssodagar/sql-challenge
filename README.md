# sql-challenge

Created new repository under name of sql-challenge
downloaded data from the homework all csv files
 
created EmployeeSQL folder inside sql-challenge to uploade all the work.

Created quick dbd erd to show the image of the tables
exported to create sql schemata
copied this schemata to start building queries

I have created a folder under name of .sql file of your queries to show all the data analysis works

To complete this homework I had used past class work slides and also hurdle with one of my class mate. 
Also google to see how to save and upload into the folders.
